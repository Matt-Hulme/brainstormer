# Server Startup Policy

## Core Rule
**DO NOT start an instance of the frontend or backend servers unless explicitly requested by the user.**

## Guidelines
1. Never run development servers automatically as part of code analysis, debugging, or general assistance
2. Do not execute commands like:
   - `npm run dev` (frontend)
   - `npm start` (frontend)
   - `yarn dev` (frontend)
   - `python -m uvicorn` (backend)
   - `fastapi dev` (backend)
   - Any other server startup commands

3. Only start servers when the user specifically asks to:
   - Run the development server
   - Start the frontend/backend
   - Test the application locally
   - Debug server-related issues

4. When the user does request server startup:
   - Confirm which server(s) they want started
   - Use the appropriate command for their environment
   - Provide clear instructions about how to stop the server

## Rationale
- Prevents unexpected resource usage
- Avoids port conflicts
- Maintains user control over their development environment
- Ensures servers are only running when actually needed

## Exception
This rule can be overridden only when the user explicitly requests server startup or when troubleshooting server-specific issues that require the server to be running.
