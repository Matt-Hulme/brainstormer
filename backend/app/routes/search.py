                    - Generate at least 100 words or phrases related to "{search.query}"
                    - Include both single words and multi-word phrases, evenly mixed
                    - The words should not be organized in any particular order
                    - Ensure diversity across different fields: science, medicine, gaming, design, history, etc.
                    - Each item should be on its own line with NO prefix characters (no bullet points, no dashes)
                    - Do not number your list
                    - Separate items using ONLY line breaks

                    The goal is to provide a wide range of potential connections to "{search.query}" across different domains and contexts."""
